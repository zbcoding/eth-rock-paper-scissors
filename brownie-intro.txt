in an empty folder for development run
brownie init

brownie compile will compile contract (.sol) to the build folder
python scripts (like for deployment) go in scripts folders
contracts go in contracts folder
interfaces go in interfaces folder
python tests (pytest) go in tests folder

brownie run deploy.py --network kovan
this will compile and run the python script (in this case to deploy) on the kovan test network

brownie test path_to_test
this will run the python script in your test folder


brownie run '.\eth smart contract yield\scripts\deploy.py' --network kovan

After "brownie compile" your contracts, brownie can import the compiled (like for a deploy script)
e.g. from brownie import YourContractName
